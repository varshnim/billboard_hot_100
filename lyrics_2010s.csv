I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin' to our favorite song

Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, and he looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight","I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!

Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)

Just gonna sand there and watch me burn
Well that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well that's all right because our love is a lie
Our love is a lie
VERSE 01: 
You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach, a wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I will do is
HOOK:
VERSE 02: 
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your tempers just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
VERSE 03: 
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to next extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the light
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to
VERSE 04: BKP
This morning, we wake, together in our face
Red lipstick as we lay here in our wake of discussion
Shh...baby, speak softly, tell me we'll be ok so
When you push me into the abyss tonight that I will be able to make you follow me?!
Try and love me so I can scream at you not to love me
I'll run out the room and follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so gone, hug me
Then tell me how stupid I am, but I know you'll always love me
Then after this, punch me, in this aftermath of the
Destructive path that we've been on, Bonnie and Cylde but I
Know that how many times I tell you I love you
We'll have each other's backs, cause baby this is ugly
Together, we can change the world, let's not destroy the world before we are set upon it
You yelled at me again, yeah, but who's listening?
I may have said you are a bitch three times, I'm starting too lose count
But together, our love is forever, but I've refused to lose you
This love is too huge, if you leave out I'll blow about three thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit your friends can say about it
Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
HOOK: ","It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow

I drink too much
